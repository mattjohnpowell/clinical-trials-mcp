# Next Steps for Clinical Trials MCP Server

This document outlines recommended steps to enhance and improve the Clinical Trials MCP server.

## Initial Setup - Completed Tasks

- [x] Create basic MCP server structure
- [x] Implement search-clinical-trials tool
- [x] Implement get-trial-details tool
- [x] Set up TypeScript build process
- [x] Create VS Code integration with .vscode/mcp.json
- [x] Set up testing examples
- [x] Add Claude for Desktop configuration
- [x] Create documentation in README.md and testing-guide.md

## Functionality Enhancements

- [ ] 1. **Advanced Filtering Tool**
   - [ ] Implement a specialized tool for filtering trials by multiple criteria simultaneously
   - [ ] Support boolean logic (AND, OR) for more complex queries
   - [ ] Add pagination support for large result sets

- [ ] 2. **Geographic Search Tool**
   - [ ] Add radius-based search to find trials near a specific location
   - [ ] Support for searching by city/region, not just country
   - [ ] Include distance information in results

- [ ] 3. **Statistical Analysis Tool**
   - [ ] Provide aggregated statistics about clinical trials
   - [ ] Show trends over time for conditions, interventions, or sponsors
   - [ ] Generate visualizations of trial data

## Technical Improvements

- [ ] 1. **Response Quality**
   - [x] Improve error handling with more specific error messages
   - [x] Add retry logic for API failures
   - [ ] Implement proper logging for debugging

- [ ] 2. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Add caching layer for frequently accessed trial data
   - [ ] Implement request throttling to respect API limits
   - [ ] Optimize XML parsing for faster response times

- [ ] 3. **Server Robustness**
   - [x] Add unit and integration tests
   - [ ] Implement health check endpoint
   - [ ] Create monitoring for server status and performance

## Data Enhancement

- [ ] 1. **Result Enrichment**
   - [ ] Cross-reference trials with PubMed for related publications
   - [ ] Add links to relevant medical information for conditions
   - [ ] Include simplified explanations of medical terminology

- [ ] 2. **Additional Data Sources**
   - [ ] Integrate with ClinicalTrials.gov API for broader coverage
   - [ ] Add support for European Union Clinical Trials Register
   - [ ] Include pharmaceutical company trial registries where available

- [ ] 3. **Historical Data**
   - [ ] Add capability to track changes in trial status over time
   - [ ] Include results of completed trials where available
   - [ ] Provide citation information for published trial results

## User Experience

- [ ] 1. **Interactive Features**
   - [ ] Support for "follow-up" queries that reference previous results
   - [ ] "Similar trials" suggestion feature
   - [ ] Save/bookmark capability for interesting trials

- [ ] 2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation with examples
   - [ ] Build interactive tutorial for new users
   - [ ] Add developer guide for extending the server

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- [ ] 1. **Containerization**
   - [ ] Dockerize the application for easier deployment
   - [ ] Create Docker Compose setup for local development
   - [ ] Provide Kubernetes configuration for production deployment

- [ ] 2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - [ ] Implement version-controlled releases
   - [ ] Add automated dependency updates

- [ ] 3. **Security**
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - [ ] Add authentication for sensitive operations
   - [ ] Create audit logging for all API requests

## Example Implementation Priority (First 3 Tasks)

- [ ] 1. **Implement Caching Layer**
   - [ ] Add Redis or in-memory cache for trial data
   - [ ] Set appropriate TTL based on data update frequency
   - [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategy

- [ ] 2. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - [ ] Add more descriptive error messages
   - [ ] Implement proper try/catch blocks throughout the codebase
   - [ ] Add logging with different severity levels

- [x] 3. **Add Unit Tests**
   - [x] Set up Jest or similar testing framework
   - [x] Create tests for the API client functions
   - [x] Mock external API responses for reliable testing
